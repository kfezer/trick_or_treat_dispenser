It's a voice-powered trick or treat dispenser!!
This is a very simple voice activated treat dispenser running 2 raspberry Pis and a Matrix Voice. The key is to it running porcupine, an open source wake-word engine from PicoVoice:

It's highly optimized and light weight. So much so that this same model should be able to run on a microcontroller. 



Big thanks to the team at Matrix. Most of this code is taken from this example here:
